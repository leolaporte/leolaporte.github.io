# Mission Accomplished

I created this site in the midst of a pandemic. Now two years later, it's over. Right?

Today mask mandates are lifted in our county and, despite [cowardly quibbling from the CDC](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mask-mandates-can-people-stop-wearing-masks-covid-rcna14587), most of the US. It seems the pandemic ends with a whimper, not a bang. Sunday's mostly-maskless Superbowl seemed to be the party we've all been waiting for. And, yet, I'm not exactly ready to celebrate. Personally, I'm planning to tiptoe back, mask at the ready. I'd love to make a pyre in the backyard to burn them all, but what if there's a new virulent variant? We still have Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ and Ω if we need them. 

But, for now, I'm willing to say Mission Accomplished. Good job everyone. Let's say a prayer for the nearly one million dead in the US, nearly six million worldwide (a chilling number) and get back to living. Save the remaining ivermectin for the horses, shall we?

Oh, and get your goldurn vaccine, will ya? For me? For all of us!
