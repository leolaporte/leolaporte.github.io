# Easy Hugo


If you can read this I'm too close.

Close to nirvana that is! I'm posting this using emacs and an emacs extension called [easy-hugo](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo). I'm writing this in Markdown mode, but it also supports org-mode, HTML, AsciiDoc, and a number of other major modes. Works with S3, github, Google cloud storage, etc. 

Honestly this wouldn't be a big deal, but I'm really trying to find ways to post more often. And that means reducing the friction of writing as much as possible. Emacs is always open on any computer I'm using. Which now means... so is my blog.
