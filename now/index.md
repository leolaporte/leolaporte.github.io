### Working on learning Lisp 
Wed 04 May 2022 11:20:05 PM PDT

  I got pretty good at Racket (a version of  Scheme) by reading [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org) and taking a related online class from Gregor Kilczales from the University of British Columbia on [EDX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home). Good enough to earn 37 out of 50 stars in the 2021 Advent of Code (although I stopped more because I ran out of interest than I ran out of Scheme).. My solutions are on [Github](https://github.com/leolaporte/AOC/tree/main/AOC21). I'm really proud of them.
  
  I've been programming for fun for a long time - more than 40 years. I wrote a daemon dialer for my Mac BBS in 68000 assembler in 1986. I know it was 1986 because I remember watching the Space Shuttle Challenger blow up while I was doing it. 
  
  A few years ago I decided to start over and learn how to program right. That's when I started HtDP and Racket. But everyone agrees the king of languages is Lisp. [esr](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond) says:
  
  >Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

So now I'm working on that. I like Lisp because it's exactly as old as I am and it hasn't changed in 40 years. Unlike me. 
  
  I've been using the following books to learn:
  
  1. [Common Lisp, A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computing by David Touretzky](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/)
  3. [Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/)  
  2. [ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html)
  2. [On Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html)
  
  I recommend all four in that order. I'm hoping to do this year's Advent of Code in Lisp. And get all 50 stars, too. 

### Learning Emacs 
Wed 04 May 2022 11:45:11 PM PDT

Part of learning Lisp is learning Emacs. They go hand-in-hand. I don't think I can really become adept at it in my remaining 18 years but it's fun to try. I'm also trying to learn its org-mode for journaling, note-taking, and list making. It's pretty handy. 

### Planning a cruise to Alaska 
Wed 04 May 2022 11:20:39 PM PDT

  Sometimes I think the best part of travelling is planning the trip. The expectation is thrilling. I'm using [Notion](https://notion.so) to plan it out. Lisa and I are going with Paul Thurrott (my Windows Weekly co-host) and his wife plus 100 or so TWiT listeners this July.

### Coming to grips with aging 
Wed 04 May 2022 11:40:07 PM PDT

   My mom turns 90 in January my dad next July. They're both sharp and healthy but they're slowing down and I know I won't have many more years with them. I'm 65. Retirement age.  
   
   According to the [Life Expetancy Calculator](https://www.livingto100.com/calculator/age) I have about 18 years left. That's it. I worry about being a burden to my family in my later years, even though my parents aren't yet. I've read Atul Gawande's excellent (and sad) [Being Mortal](http://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/) and it scares me. I'm an atheist so I don't have any hopes of an afterlife. Although, as I get nearer to the end I notice that Nick Bostrom's [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) gets more appealing. Even more believable. 
   
   I also wonder if I shouldn't retire soon so I can enjoy my remaining years. (I have about the same amount of time left as I've been doing TWiT. That seems like a very short time.) I want to travel and my work schedule makes it hard to go on the longer trips I dream about, especially an around the world cruise. I have enough money saved to retire fairly comfortably, even go on that cruise, but I still am the primary support for several family members and I am afraid of leaving them in the lurch. And then I wonder if *not* working will drive me nuts. I think it's likely I'll begin to work less and less over the next few years and by the time I'm 70 just do one, audio-only, podcast a week until my voice or my brains give out.

### Reading 

I'm on book four of the very fun [Bobiverse series](https://www.audible.com/series/Bobiverse-Audiobooks/B01M1RDL6W) from Dennis E. Taylor. Ray Porter reads it for Audible and he's just perfect, as he was narrating the excellent Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. Porter's a master of modern wise-ass delivery. (Wed 04 May 2022 11:51:48 PM PDT)

Also attempting David Graeber's The Dawn of Everything (archeology and world pre-history) and I'm mired in the slog - book six - of the Wheel of Time. I may not finish that one. I only have 18 years left, remember. (Wed 04 May 2022 11:54:56 PM PDT)

### TV

I watch way too much TV. Several hours a night with Lisa. Loved Succession on HBO and Slow Horses on AppleTV+ but I'm having a hard time finding anything I love as much these days. Just started Outer Range on Amazon Prime - it's kind of like Yosemite meets Stranger Things and I'm not sure whether I like it yet. Also started Under the Banner of Heaven on Hulu. It's creepy and the partiarchal Mormonism in it hits a little too painfully close to home in our newly Christian Nationalistic America. (Thu 05 May 2022 12:00:15 AM PDT)
