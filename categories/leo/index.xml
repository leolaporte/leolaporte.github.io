My name is Leo Laporte.</h1>
<p>I am a US-based journalist specializing in technology coverage on radio, TV, and the Internet.</p>
<p>This site (leo.fm) is a place I store quick posts. I guess it&rsquo;s the closest thing I have to a blog these days. Well done finding it.</p>
<p>leo.fm is a static site generated from markdown files using <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Hugo</a>. The site template is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">LoveIt</a>. The server is running Debian and nginx out of the TWiT studios.</p>

<p>I also host and produce multiple technology-focused podcasts at <a href="https://twit.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">TWiT</a>.

<p>I don&rsquo;t use Facebook or Twitter, preferring instead to use a federated social network called Mastodon. Our official TWiT Mastodon instance is at <a href="https://twit.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">TWiT.social</a> and I am <a href="https://twit.social/@leo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">leo@twit.social</a>.</p>

<p>For secure messages to me (or anyone) don&rsquo;t use email. My secure <a href="https://signal.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Signal</a> messaging ID is 302-536-8948.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GNU Privacy Guard (gpg)</a> or S/MIME signing for email whenever possible. Mail from me will be signed with my PGP key with the short ID 4567B47C or GlobalSign S/MIME certificate ID 582BC167. Email addresses are easily spoofed, but signatures can generally be trusted. If you receive an email from me that is not signed, reply requesting a signed version before trusting it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to encrypt your email to me, or verify a message from me, use my public PGP key: <a href="https://leo.ist/Leo%20Laporte%202018-2022%20%284567B47C%29%20%E2%80%93%20Public.asc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Leo Laporte 2018-2022 (4567B47C)</a>. I create new keys every few years so be sure to use this key and not older versions. (This key is dated June 8, 2018 and identified as <a href="mailto:leo@leoville.com">leo@leoville.com</a>). It&rsquo;s probably easier (and even more secure) to use <a href="https://signal.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Signal</a> messenger (302-536-8948). My phone rejects calls from unknown numbers, but you can leave a text or voice message.</p>

<h3 id="answers-to-questions-people-frequently-ask-me">Answers to questions people frequently ask me:</h3>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the best way to stay secure online?</strong></p>
<p>Start by using a password manager.</p>
<p>We all need to use passwords all the time. The problem with passwords is that good ones are hard to remember. So people often use weak (but memorable passwords) and reuse them on site after site. A better way is to use a program that generates long, really random (hence unmemorable) passwords and keeps track of them so you don‚Äôt have to. That‚Äôs a password manager. If you only use your Mac and an iPhone, Apple can do this for you with the keychain. Your browser can also keep track of your passwords, if somewhat insecurely.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">BitWarden</a> is open-source, inexpensive, and very secure. It generates long, strong passwords and remembers them for you. <a href="https://lastpass.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Lastpass</a> and <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">1Password</a> are also excellent and work the same way.</p>
<p>Two more important tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use Gmail, follow Google‚Äôs security advice at <a href="https://google.com/security">https://google.com/security</a> ‚Äì make sure to add a recovery phone number and email.</li>
<li>Turn-on two factor authentication wherever you can.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What programming language should I learn?</strong></p>
<p>If you merely want to get a job as quickly as possible go to one of the many coding camps and study Javascript. If you want to learn the art of programming. I recommend starting right with the free textbook <a href="https://htdp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">How To Design Programs</a>. HtDP uses the free <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">DrRacket</a> language and IDE. Racket is a lisp, but as they use it in the book it‚Äôs a much simplified teaching language. It‚Äôs intended to get out of the way so you can learn coding concepts without having to struggle with language syntax.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a well-done free pair of online courses from the University of British Columbia that teaches HtDP at <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">edX.org</a>. I highly recommend them (I‚Äôve done them myself.)</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve learned how to think about programs you can study any other language and you&rsquo;ll be a better programmer for it.</p>
<p><strong>Can I promote X with you?</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate your sending along information about your product, service, web site, brilliant idea, or podcast proposal. I wish you all the best. I will read it and store it away for future reference. I don‚Äôt meet with vendors, so please don‚Äôt ask. TWiT.tv isn‚Äôt looking for any more podcasts either, but good luck with your show!</p>
<p><strong>How do I buy ads on your shows?</strong></p>
<p>Advertising Sales for TWiT is handled through Lisa Laporte, <a href="mailto:lisa@twit.tv">lisa@twit.tv</a>. Our minimum buy is $25,000. Thanks so much for your support!!</p>
<p><strong>Please help me!</strong></p>
<p>Thanks so much for writing. Unfortunately due to the volume of mail I get I just don‚Äôt have the ability to answer individual questions. I‚Äôll keep your question in mind for use on the podcasts or radio show, though. You might search my radio show web site for an answer. I‚Äôve also found that searching Google can be helpful. If you‚Äôd like to ask your question on my syndicated radio show call 1-88-88-ASK LEO from 11a-2p Pacific weekends. I appreciate hearing from you. I hope you understand why I can‚Äôt be of much help.</p>
