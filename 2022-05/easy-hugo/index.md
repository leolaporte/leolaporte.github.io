# Easy Hugo


If you can read this I'm too close.

Close to nirvana that is! I'm posting this using emacs and an emacs extension called [https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo](easy-hugo). I'm writing this in Markdown mode, but it also supports org-mode, HTML, AsciiDoc and a number of other major modes. Works with S3, github, Google cloud storage, etc.
