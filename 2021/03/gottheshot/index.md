# I Am Not Throwing Away THIS Shot

Yesterday I got the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine!

When I arrived at Kaiser they threw me a curve. "Would you like Moderna or Johnson & Johnson?" I chose Moderna for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I think the mRNA technology is very cool. The process was quick and nearly painless. Afterwards I hod to wait 15 minutes, just in case I had a bad reaction. I didn't. My arm hurts a bit today, but that's the extent of the side effects. I expect worse after the second shot, April 14. 

Now we just have to get the rest of my friends and family vaccinated and life can kind of get back to normal!
