# Am I Crazy?

I pulled the trigger on a Monster Gaming Machine. I know it's crazy, but boys just want to have fun.

See I have a three-year-old iMac Pro, but it's getting flaky and I've been eyeing my wife's [49" monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-monitor-u4919dw/apd/210-arnw/monitors-monitor-accessories) for months.

Apple's never going to do something like that! And how long before they ship something powerful that can work with an external monitor: A high-end mac Mini or a new mini-Mac Pro? 

I finally lost my patience and pulled the trigger on something [completely different](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/desktops-all-in-one-pcs/alienware-aurora-ryzen-edition-r10-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r10-desktop/wdryzr10v20hsb).

Maxed out with a Ryzen 7 5800X, nVidia GTX 3080, 128GB RAM, and dual 2TB drives (1 m.2, 1 spinning). 

I know I could save money and probably get something better by building my own or going to a custom gaming PC maker, but these components are hard to get and I figure Dell can get them faster than anyone else. Even so this baby doesn't ship 'til May. 

And as long as I'm going for a power rig, I might as well go all out with a [monster monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/new-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-aw5520qf/apd/210-auds/monitors-monitor-accessories), right?

A 55-inch OLED monitor that's absurdly expensive. (It's basically a hi-res TV but it costs a lot more.) 

I rationalize this crazy purchase because

1. I believe in open source, and like Linux as much as I like macOS. Dell supports Linux pretty well. (No I don't plan on using Windows. Ick.)
2. I really need to get to know the new PC hardware. Specifically The AMD Ryzen and the new nVidia ray-tracing GPUs.
3. I can't get an Xbox Series X or Playstation 5 to save my life, but I really want to play something new.
4. and the real reason... [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com) (it runs on Linux!)

I've been saving up for something like this for some time. It's kind of the Ultimate Gaming Machine for 2021. 

OK tell me I'm a fool. I'm ready to be roasted. Or you can come over and watch me play Valheim come May.

UPDATE: It has arrived. I've been playing with it all day and it's so fast. Super happy with the purchase. Dual booting Windows 10 with Manjaro Linux and everything is working perfectly. I think I'm in love.
