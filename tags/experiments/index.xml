<p>I like to put images in my blog posts. I think it really dresses them up. But if I have to upload all these images manually that&rsquo;s going to be a pain in the butt.</p>
<p>This image is linked in markdown:</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="https://i2.wp.com/leolaporte.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tri-hero2019-1.jpg" title="Bill and me" data-thumbnail="https://i2.wp.com/leolaporte.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tri-hero2019-1.jpg" data-sub-html="<h2>Bill and I</h2><p>Bill and me</p>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bill and I</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>OK that works fine but, the picture is hosted on my Wordpress site. I don&rsquo;t like hosting images on other sites because they can disappear without warning. That happened to a lot of the images from my previous blog and it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>Ideally an image would be on the same server as the blog. Then moving the blog would be simpler. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any automatic way to fetch a non-local image and store it locally during the Hugo render. I wish there were.</p>
<p>So for now, I have to upload the image to this server by hand. ðŸ˜‘</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
