It&rsquo;s fun to hear a &ldquo;new&rdquo; album from the artist at his peak.</p>

<p><em>Homegrown</em> was recorded in 1974 and 1975 at various venues. Young planned to release it with <em>Tonight&rsquo;s The Night</em>, but never did, perhaps because most of the record was an angry elegy for his broken relationship with actor Carrie Snodgress. But in this century, with hit breakup albums from the likes of Taylor Swift and Beyoncé (well, near breakup), Neil has finally set his anger free.</p>
<p>I always wonder what it would be like to hear a new Beatles song. Would I love it as much as I love the songs I&rsquo;ve been hearing my whole life? Here&rsquo;s my answer. Hearing these new, old, Neil Young songs for the first time is like meeting someone new and feeling like you&rsquo;ve known them forever. &ldquo;Try&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; and the classic &ldquo;Love is a Rose&rdquo; compose three perfect Neil Young songs in a row.</p>
<p>Featuring performances by Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, and Emmylou Harris, <em>Homegrown</em> is a very welcome addition to my quarantine playlist.</p>

<p>Consider it a work in progress — like me. I don’t expect to kick the bucket any time soon, but these are songs that mean a lot to me and would make for a fitting final farewell.</p>

<p>I listen to it from time to time and it makes me feel good. Maybe it will help my loved ones say goodbye.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
