It&rsquo;s like Disqus but supposedly more private.</p>
<p>So you should be able to leave a comment here!</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t. Grrr. Working on it. (But see below!)</p>
<p>Update: I can&rsquo;t figure it out for the life of me. All the code seems to be there. I&rsquo;ve set all the settings, etc. So for now, no comments. That&rsquo;s not the worst thing in the world. At least this way I don&rsquo;t have to moderate them!</p>
<p>For the time being I guess you can comment on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Ok all of a sudden comments are working! Look at the very bottom of the page! I&rsquo;m thinking it just took a few days for the folks at Commento to hook up the site. Thank you! I might want to mess with the theming a bit - the comments are so far down they&rsquo;re easy to miss. But notice the thought bubble on the lower right as you scroll down - click that to jump right to the comment section.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
