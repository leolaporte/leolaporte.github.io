<h3 id="working-on-learning-lisp">Working on learning Lisp</h3>
<p>Wed 04 May 2022 11:20:05 PM PDT</p>
<p>I got pretty good at Racket (a version of  Scheme) by reading <a href="https://htdp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">How to Design Programs</a> and taking a related online class from Gregor Kilczales from the University of British Columbia on <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx&#43;HtC1x&#43;2T2017/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">EDX</a>. Good enough to earn 37 out of 50 stars in the 2021 Advent of Code (although I stopped more because I ran out of interest than I ran out of Scheme).. My solutions are on <a href="https://github.com/leolaporte/AOC/tree/main/AOC21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Github</a>. I&rsquo;m really proud of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming for fun for a long time - more than 40 years. I wrote a daemon dialer for my Mac BBS in 68000 assembler in 1986. I know it was 1986 because I remember watching the Space Shuttle Challenger blow up while I was doing it.</p>
<p>A few years ago I decided to start over and learn how to program right. That&rsquo;s when I started HtDP and Racket. But everyone agrees the king of languages is Lisp. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">esr</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m working on that. I like Lisp because it&rsquo;s exactly as old as I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the following books to learn:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Common Lisp, A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computing by David Touretzky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">On Lisp by Paul Graham</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I recommend all four in that order. I&rsquo;m hoping to do this year&rsquo;s Advent of Code in Lisp. And get all 50 stars, too.</p>

<p>Part of learning Lisp is learning Emacs. They go hand-in-hand. I don&rsquo;t think I can really become adept at it in my remaining 18 years but it&rsquo;s fun to try. I&rsquo;m also trying to learn its org-mode for journaling, note-taking, and list making. It&rsquo;s pretty handy.</p>

<p>Wed 04 May 2022 11:20:39 PM PDT</p>
<p>Sometimes I think the best part of travelling is planning the trip. The expectation is thrilling. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://notion.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Notion</a> to plan it out. Lisa and I are going with Paul Thurrott (my Windows Weekly co-host) and his wife plus 100 or so TWiT listeners this July.</p>
<h3 id="coming-to-grips-with-aging">Coming to grips with aging</h3>
<p>Wed 04 May 2022 11:40:07 PM PDT</p>
<p>My mom turns 90 in January my dad next July. They&rsquo;re both sharp and healthy but they&rsquo;re slowing down and I know I won&rsquo;t have many more years with them. I&rsquo;m 65. Retirement age.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.livingto100.com/calculator/age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Life Expetancy Calculator</a> I have about 18 years left. That&rsquo;s it. I worry about being a burden to my family in my later years, even though my parents aren&rsquo;t yet. I&rsquo;ve read Atul Gawande&rsquo;s excellent (and sad) <a href="http://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Being Mortal</a> and it scares me. I&rsquo;m an atheist so I don&rsquo;t have any hopes of an afterlife. Although, as I get nearer to the end I notice that Nick Bostrom&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">simulation hypothesis</a> gets more appealing. Even more believable.</p>
<p>I also wonder if I shouldn&rsquo;t retire soon so I can enjoy my remaining years. (I have about the same amount of time left as I&rsquo;ve been doing TWiT. That seems like a very short time.) I want to travel and my work schedule makes it hard to go on the longer trips I dream about, especially an around the world cruise. I have enough money saved to retire fairly comfortably, even go on that cruise, but I still am the primary support for several family members and I am afraid of leaving them in the lurch. And then I wonder if <em>not</em> working will drive me nuts. I think it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;ll begin to work less and less over the next few years and by the time I&rsquo;m 70 just do one, audio-only, podcast a week until my voice or my brains give out.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m on book four of the very fun <a href="https://www.audible.com/series/Bobiverse-Audiobooks/B01M1RDL6W" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Bobiverse series</a> from Dennis E. Taylor. Ray Porter reads it for Audible and he&rsquo;s just perfect, as he was narrating the excellent Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. Porter&rsquo;s a master of modern wise-ass delivery. (Wed 04 May 2022 11:51:48 PM PDT)</p>
<p>Also attempting David Graeber&rsquo;s The Dawn of Everything (archeology and world pre-history) and I&rsquo;m mired in the slog - book six - of the Wheel of Time. I may not finish that one. I only have 18 years left, remember. (Wed 04 May 2022 11:54:56 PM PDT)</p>
<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>
<p>I watch way too much TV. Several hours a night with Lisa. Loved Succession on HBO and Slow Horses on AppleTV+ but I&rsquo;m having a hard time finding anything I love as much these days. Just started Outer Range on Amazon Prime - it&rsquo;s kind of like Yosemite meets Stranger Things and I&rsquo;m not sure whether I like it yet. Also started Under the Banner of Heaven on Hulu. It&rsquo;s creepy and the partiarchal Mormonism in it hits a little too painfully close to home in our newly Christian Nationalistic America.
