<p>The <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/frequent-rapid-testing-could-turn-national-covid-19-tide-within-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">study</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These rapid tests are contagiousness tests,” said senior co-author Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They are extremely effective in detecting COVID-19 when people are contagious.”</p>
<p>They are also affordable, he added. The rapid tests can cost as little as $1 each and return results in 15 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Best of all, &ldquo;testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid-turnaround COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is something we could do today to end the pandemic by Christmas. The FDA has already approved the tests.</p>
