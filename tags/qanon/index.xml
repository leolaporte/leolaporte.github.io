<p>From an article in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161266/qanon-classism-marjorie-taylor-greene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">The New Republic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Minnesota’s Joanne Miller and Christina Farhart and Colorado State University’s Kyle Saunders conducted a survey examining support for conspiracy theories, including birtherism and 9/11 trutherism. In a result unsurprising to those who follow this research, they found that higher levels of political knowledge actually deepened the likelihood that conservatives with low trust in people and major institutions would endorse right-wing conspiracy theories. In a section reviewing previous research on the subject, the authors explained that political sophisticates “have the ability to make connections between abstract principles and more concrete attitudes and are therefore more fully able to notice the implications of specific attitudes for their worldviews.” “Because politically knowledgeable people care more about politics and hold stronger political attitudes,” they added, “they are especially likely to want to protect those attitudes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers conclude that &ldquo;people will believe what they want to believe in spite of available data and evidence.&rdquo;</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
