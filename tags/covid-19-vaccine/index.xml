<p>When I arrived at Kaiser they threw me a curve. &ldquo;Would you like Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson?&rdquo; I chose Moderna for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I think the mRNA technology is very cool. The process was quick and nearly painless. Afterwards I hod to wait 15 minutes, just in case I had a bad reaction. I didn&rsquo;t. My arm hurts a bit today, but that&rsquo;s the extent of the side effects. I expect worse after the second shot, April 14.</p>
<p>Now we just have to get the rest of my friends and family vaccinated and life can kind of get back to normal!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
