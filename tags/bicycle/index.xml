Until last week.</p>
<p>The trip is only a couple of miles, and takes fewer than 10 minutes, but there&rsquo;s one spot that always gives me the heebie jeebies.</p>

<p>The Corona Road overpass is a narrow bridge with an even narrower bike path. Whenever I cross it I try to wait for a break in the traffic, and that&rsquo;s been a lot easier during quarantine. But as the traffic&rsquo;s been getting busier I&rsquo;ve been getting more worried. And then, last week, the worst happened. One hour before I would have been crossing the bridge a  bicyclist was hit and killed by a driver under the influence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve crossed that spot hundreds of times, but no more. I don&rsquo;t know Joze, but I feel for him and his family. From now on I&rsquo;ll be crossing that bridge in my car and reserve my rides for somewhere safer.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
