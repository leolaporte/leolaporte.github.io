Today on <a href="https://youtu.be/D6UQqlUMfiw?t=8231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">MacBreak Weekly</a> Alex Lindsay recommended using a cool iPhone app to help make masks more effective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bellus3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Belus3D</a> is a free app for iOS that creates a 3D model of your head in a few seconds. I&rsquo;ve used it before and it&rsquo;s pretty amazing, but there never seemed to be anything useful to do with it. Until now.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/images/maskframe.gif" title=" Creepy 3D model of Leo&amp;rsquo;s head " data-thumbnail="/images/maskframe.gif" data-sub-html="<h2>A 3D model of my head with the mask fitter attached</h2><p> Creepy 3D model of Leo&amp;rsquo;s head </p>">

    </figure></p>
<p>You can use the 3D model of your head to print a custom fitted plastic frame designed to make masks more effective. The idea is that the frame will hold down the mask fabric to make a better seal between the mask and the face. The frame has four t-mounts for elastic bands to hold the mask to your face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ordered a couple of different sizes (tall and premium) from <a href="https://www.cadmusdental.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Cadmus Dental</a> (you can do that from the Belus3D app). I&rsquo;ll let you know when they arrive and how well they work.</p>
<p>Next step, build a Leo clone so TWiT can continue forever! Mwa-ha-ha-ha!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
