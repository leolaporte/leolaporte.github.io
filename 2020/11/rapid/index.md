A new study from CU Boulder (my son's alma mater) and Harvard's TF Chan School of Public Health points to a way forward in the pandemic.

The [study](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/frequent-rapid-testing-could-turn-national-covid-19-tide-within-weeks/) says

> “These rapid tests are contagiousness tests,” said senior co-author Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They are extremely effective in detecting COVID-19 when people are contagious.”

> They are also affordable, he added. The rapid tests can cost as little as $1 each and return results in 15 minutes. 

Best of all, "testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid-turnaround COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks."

This is something we could do today to end the pandemic by Christmas. The FDA has already approved the tests.
