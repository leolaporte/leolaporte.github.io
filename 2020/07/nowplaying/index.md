# New Music from 1975

I've always loved Neil Young. It's fun to hear a "new" album from the artist at his peak.

_Homegrown_ was recorded in 1974 and 1975 at various venues. Young planned to release it with _Tonight's The Night_, but never did, perhaps because most of the record was an angry elegy for his broken relationship with actor Carrie Snodgress. But in this century, with hit breakup albums from the likes of Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© (well, near breakup), Neil has finally set his anger free. 

I always wonder what it would be like to hear a new Beatles song. Would I love it as much as I love the songs I've been hearing my whole life? Here's my answer. Hearing these new, old, Neil Young songs for the first time is like meeting someone new and feeling like you've known them forever. "Try" followed by "Mexico" and the classic "Love is a Rose" compose three perfect Neil Young songs in a row. 

Featuring performances by Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, and Emmylou Harris, _Homegrown_ is a very welcome addition to my quarantine playlist.
