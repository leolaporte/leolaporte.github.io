# Funereal Playlist


I know it sounds morbid, but I’ve made a list of songs I want played at my funeral service.

Consider it a work in progress — like me. I don’t expect to kick the bucket any time soon, but these are songs that mean a lot to me and would make for a fitting final farewell.

I listen to it from time to time and it makes me feel good. Maybe it will help my loved ones say goodbye. 

Any suggestions?
