# Playing with Hugo Shortcodes


Hugo has shortcodes that are embedded in the markdown of posts.

This is an example of the `figure` shortcode.

{{< figure src="/images/athens.jpg" caption="Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Athens" width=500 >}}

And this is a gist from my github account:

{{< gist leolaporte 2004ed1b383d122bf08ff5daab504e3d >}}

Et voila
