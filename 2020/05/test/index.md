# Testing comments


I just paid $60 for a year subscription to the [commento.io](https://commento.io) comment system. It's like Disqus but supposedly more private.

So you should be able to leave a comment here!

But you can't. Grrr. Working on it. (But see below!)

Update: I can't figure it out for the life of me. All the code seems to be there. I've set all the settings, etc. So for now, no comments. That's not the worst thing in the world. At least this way I don't have to moderate them!

For the time being I guess you can comment on Twitter.

**UPDATE**: Ok all of a sudden comments are working! Look at the very bottom of the page! I'm thinking it just took a few days for the folks at Commento to hook up the site. Thank you! I might want to mess with the theming a bit - the comments are so far down they're easy to miss. But notice the thought bubble on the lower right as you scroll down - click that to jump right to the comment section.
