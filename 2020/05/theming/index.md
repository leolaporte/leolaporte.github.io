# Hello Dark Mode My Old Friend


I've finally settled on a look for this new blog: [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/). Hugo has a huge number of themes, with many different capabilities, but this seems to do everything I want. You can choose light or dark mode in the upper right hand corner. There's an RSS feed. And the organizational system makes sense to me. I'm not turning on search, although it is supported. Maybe after the thing gets big and unwieldy.

I'd really like to port all the entries from leolaporte.com over - but that's a big project. Some day.

Enjoy!
