# "Get Your Knees Off Our Necks"

Take 30 minutes to watch this eulogy for George Floyd. So moving and powerful.

I feel like our country is at the top of a rollercoaster at this moment. We can either slip backwards into authoritarism -- there's a plurality of Americans who would choose a strong-man's response to current events -- or we can advance into a future with justice for all and a renewed committment to protect the earth and our citizens. The choice is clear and the decision point is here. It's time for the country to move forward, not backward.
