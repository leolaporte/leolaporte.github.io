# Outblowing


Lisa and I are trying to take walks every evening after dinner. Seeing nature blithely go on with its business is kind of reassuring.

The Dutch have a word for it, [*uitwaaien*](http://nautil.us/blog/the-simple-dutch-cure-for-stress)[^1]. Literally it means out-blowing, getting some exercise in the fresh wind. Out with the old bad air, in with the new. Theyâ€™ve been doing it for 100 years in the Netherlands. When times get tough, go play in the wind.

I feel better already.
