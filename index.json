Good enough to earn 37 out of 50 stars in the 2021 Advent of Code (although I stopped more because I ran out of interest than I ran out of Scheme).. My solutions are on Github. I’m really proud of them. I’ve been programming for fun for a long time - more than 40 years. I wrote a daemon dialer for my Mac BBS in 68000 assembler in 1986. I know it was 1986 because I remember watching the Space Shuttle Challenger blow up while I was doing it. A few years ago I decided to start over and learn how to program right. That’s when I started HtDP and Racket. But everyone agrees the king of languages is Lisp. esr says: Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot. So now I’m working on that. I like Lisp because it’s exactly as old as I am and it hasn’t changed in 40 years. Unlike me. I’ve been using the following books to learn: Common Lisp, A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computing by David Touretzky Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham On Lisp by Paul Graham I recommend all four in that order. I’m hoping to do this year’s Advent of Code in Lisp. And get all 50 stars, too.

They’re both sharp and healthy but they’re slowing down and I know I won’t have many more years with them. I’m 65. Retirement age. According to the Life Expetancy Calculator I have about 18 years left. That’s it. I worry about being a burden to my family in my later years, even though my parents aren’t yet. I’ve read Atul Gawande’s excellent (and sad) Being Mortal and it scares me. I’m an atheist so I don’t have any hopes of an afterlife. Although, as I get nearer to the end I notice that Nick Bostrom’s simulation hypothesis gets more appealing. Even more believable. I also wonder if I shouldn’t retire soon so I can enjoy my remaining years. (I have about the same amount of time left as I’ve been doing TWiT. That seems like a very short time.) I want to travel and my work schedule makes it hard to go on the longer trips I dream about, especially an around the world cruise. I have enough money saved to retire fairly comfortably, even go on that cruise, but I still am the primary support for several family members and I am afraid of leaving them in the lurch. And then I wonder if not working will drive me nuts. I think it’s likely I’ll begin to work less and less over the next few years and by the time I’m 70 just do one, audio-only, podcast a week until my voice or my brains give out.

But I think it’s time to make a change. Commento is well supported by my blog engine, Hugo. It’s relatively inexpensive with a good set of features, but…. this is such a low volume blog that I don’t think it’s worth the $5/month for Commento. That’s no reflection on it - it’s a nice system. But I like the idea of the Fediverse and I’d like to support the Mastodon instance I run, twit.social. It turns out it’s pretty easy to use Mastodon comments with Hugo. I found a great post by Carl Schwan that included the code to insert in my theme. A simple copy and paste and - wow!- it worked! I modified the default header to include a link to twit.social. The only trick is to quickly edit the post metadata to point to the toot announcing the post. So it’s not automatic, but it’s not hard either. I’m hoping that this will facilitate conversation on posts here, and, not incidentally, drive some traffic on Mastodon. Thanks, Carl. To try it out - press “Reply” below and it will open a Mastodon form in your browser. Your comment will appear here and on your Mastodon account. If you don’t have a Mastodon account, join us at twit.social. We’d love to have you! UPDAYE: Well for some reason that’s not working at all. Sigh. I’ll keep banging on it. I love the idea of creating a conversation about posts on Mastodon, especially since I’m already running my own instance. Ironically one of the replies to this post was a complaint about my facetious cookie banner. Without Commento.io there are no cookies, so I’m turning that off too. Finally, I had it half working using Carl’s code, but I did need to get some Javascript, purify.min.js, accesible. Carl uses it to sanitize HTML in comments. I stuck that dang code everywhere, but finally put it in /static/assets/js/ and lo and behold, it works! I still have a lot to learn about Hugo.

In a result unsurprising to those who follow this research, they found that higher levels of political knowledge actually deepened the likelihood that conservatives with low trust in people and major institutions would endorse right-wing conspiracy theories. In a section reviewing previous research on the subject, the authors explained that political sophisticates “have the ability to make connections between abstract principles and more concrete attitudes and are therefore more fully able to notice the implications of specific attitudes for their worldviews.” “Because politically knowledgeable people care more about politics and hold stronger political attitudes,” they added, “they are especially likely to want to protect those attitudes.” The researchers conclude that “people will believe what they want to believe in spite of available data and evidence.” ","date":"2021-02-07","objectID":"/2021/02/qanon/:0:0","tags":["politics","qanon","conspiracy theory"],"title":"It's Right Against Wrong, Not Smart Against Dumb","uri":"/2021/02/qanon/"},{"categories":["blog"],"content":"I admit the timing is confusing.

Here are some preliminary notes. This MBP 13\" is identical to the previous Intel 13\" outwardly, but inside, it’s very different. I maxed it out with 16GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD and it’s noticeably snappier. No the fan is never audible, and even when rendering a large 4K Motion file it only gets a little warm. And battery life is the best of any system I’ve ever used. It depends a lot on what I’m doing but it’s always at least 9 hours and usually around 15. All that’s great but you have to weigh it against the issues of software compatibility. Over time Apple Silicon’s advantages over Intel will increase, while software issues will gradually disappear. But today the issue of incompatible software could be significant1, especially at the edges. The Is Apple Silicon Ready website has a decent list of some big names that are (and aren’t yet) native. But under the surface lurk many thousands of programs that just don’t run. All Apple programs run natively. Many popular Mac programs run natively. Many CLI and dev tools don’t run at all. Yes it’s a cool architecture, yes it’s really fast, but unless you feel like your machine is slow (I didn’t feel that way with any Macs in the past couple of years), and you’re sure the programs you need will work, it might be worth waiting until the Mac dev community gets with it. I’ll keep track of the issues I’m encountering in the following table.2 Note: I’m using Macports as my package manager. Program Native? Runs? Notes Google Chrome (87) 😍 😍 Stadia works, too!

Many apps have ARM versions; so maybe it’s a Big Sur issue? Update: I built Racket CS from source (using the latest version from Github). It’s now Apple native and man is it FAST! Faster even than Racket BC on my iMac Pro with 64GB of RAM. Honestly, two months in, I don’t even want to use any other computer. The M1 MacBook is the best laptop I’ve ever owned. I’m very excited to see what Apple does in 2021. I’ll probably replace all our Macs. Intel just doesn’t cut it any more.

This is how I responded. I’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can’t tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I’m not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air. I do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t pursue being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.1 In interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn. I think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it. Be open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can’t see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?” Studying improv was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with “yes, and” - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you’re going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don’t let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls it flow. You’re always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names. This is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, “don’t interrupt,” “slow down,” “don’t curse,” etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious. It’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat.

This one, from 2016, truly hits home. Life is short, so it’s worth eliminating the time wasters. For one, defending yourself online. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn’t designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it’s better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. But that’s just one of many powerful ideas in this essay. Please take 10 of your precious remaining minutes to read it. One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you’ll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.

End Daylight Saving Time! The august Academy of Sleep Medicine has finally proclaimed the truth. The AASM supports a switch to permanent standard time, explaining in the statement that standard time more closely aligns with the daily rhythms of the body’s internal clock. The position statement also cites evidence of increased risks of motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular events, and mood disturbances following the annual “spring forward” to daylight saving time. “Permanent, year-round standard time is the best choice to most closely match our circadian sleep-wake cycle,” said lead author Dr. M. Adeel Rishi, a pulmonology, sleep medicine and critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and vice chair of the AASM Public Safety Committee. “Daylight saving time results in more darkness in the morning and more light in the evening, disrupting the body’s natural rhythm.” The AASM position statement on daylight saving time has been endorsed by the following organizations: American Academy of Cardiovascular Sleep Medicine American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine California Sleep Society Dakotas Sleep Society Kentucky Sleep Society Maryland Sleep Society Michigan Academy of Sleep Medicine Missouri Sleep Society National PTA National Safety Council Society for Research on Biological Rhythms Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine Southern Sleep Society Start School Later Tennessee Sleep Society Wisconsin Sleep Society World Sleep Society.

It’s fun to hear a “new” album from the artist at his peak. Homegrown, Neil Young Homegrown was recorded in 1974 and 1975 at various venues. Young planned to release it with Tonight’s The Night, but never did, perhaps because most of the record was an angry elegy for his broken relationship with actor Carrie Snodgress. But in this century, with hit breakup albums from the likes of Taylor Swift and Beyoncé (well, near breakup), Neil has finally set his anger free. I always wonder what it would be like to hear a new Beatles song. Would I love it as much as I love the songs I’ve been hearing my whole life? Here’s my answer.

Remember my post from last month about creating a mask fitter using Belus3D? Well they’re arrived and I have to say they really work. The idea is that the fitter, contoured perfectly to your face thanks to the software generated model, seals the mask material around your mouth and nose so that no air escapes around the edges. You are breathing only through the mask. I’ve ordered about eight of them from three different companies. All three specialize in printing dental implants. I used the three featured on the Belus3D ordering page. Cadmus Dental took almost a month to get me the two designs I ordered - the tall and premium fitters. Master Labs took less than a week, but they’re local. I was only able to order the standard design from them. I’m still waiting for the fitters I ordered from Forecast3D but I think they’re on their way. If you’re in a hurry go with Master Labs. All the fitters are printed from PLA plastic and seem pretty durable. The Standard fitter is all you need. All cost roughly $20 each. This is me using the Master Labs Standard fitter over one of my homemade cloth masks. Go ahead, come at me Covid! Leo wearing the standard mask fitter \" Go ahead, come at me Covid! According to Belus3D The NIH has listed the Bellus3D Mask Fitter as appropriate for clinical use. and The Loma Linda University School of Dentistry has worked with [Belus3d] on the development and testing of the Mask Fitter and have found that it enhances the peripheral seal of a mask. I wore a standard surgical mask with the fitter and a face shield to the grocery store yesterday and I felt invulnerable. Of course I sterilized the fitter and shield immediately afterwards, washed thoroughly, and tossed my clothes into the wash. My shoes are still on the steps outside. I know, I’m paranoid, but it’s not a lot of effort and I really don’t want to get or spread Covid-19! I highly recommend these fitters. Wearing one protects me as well as it protects others. OK this is the last time I’ll post about masks. I think I’ve covered the subject pretty thoroughly, and by now you know how I feel about them. If everyone wears a simple mask we can go back to life as usual in as little as a month. Why wouldn’t you wear one?

This is from more than two months ago but it’s more important than ever. Why simple cloth masks work best, from the Journal of Aerosol and Air Quality Research1 By donning a homemade mask made of any 2-ply or more dense fabric, [Americans] would be able shrink their inhalation/exhalation radius immensely and help stem the current outbreaks that are ravaging their country. In addition, cloth masks can be tailor made to fit snugly and close the gaping holes created by poorly fitting surgical masks. Furthermore, a cloth mask can be easily decontaminated as it can be washed with over-the-counter disinfectants, heated in an oven or treated by steam sterilization above 70°C for longer than 5 mins, all proven methods to effectively inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Chin et al., 2020). Surgical masks are designed for single-use and can be decontaminated by any of the above methods, including dry-heating in an electric rice cooker (Lin et al., 2017). However, the potential deformation and degraded effectiveness of the mask’s polymer layer after repeated treatments should be further evaluated. With that, the surgical masks are then thrown away and added to the mounting global plastic pollution problem. Thus, the environmental cost of discarded surgical masks is already being outlined and with the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow, cautious transition back to normal, this cost will grow unabated unless alternative mask usage is widely promoted. Still many of the people I see on the street are not wearing masks of any kind. And most of those who do are wearing poorly-fitted disposable surgical masks. Exactly the kind of mask this article is arguing against. Since people seem unwilling to do anything to protect others, I’m going to have to take matters into my own hands by fully protecting myself whenever I go out using my own home-made PPE. Kind of like Jude Law in “Contagion” minus the oxygen tank. Jude Law in “ContagionJude Law in his home-made PPE from the movie Contagion \" Jude Law in “Contagion I’m still waiting for my 3D printed mask fitter to come from Cadmus Dental. When it arrives I believe I’ll be able to sew mask squares composed of two layers of cotton with chiffon or silk in between that will provide almost perfect protection and still remain highly breathable. I also have a yard of meltblown polypropylene fabric to try out. Washing depletes the static charge on the chiffon, silk, or poly but virgourous ironing restores it. I iron all my masks after washing to further disinfect them. Plus putting on a freshly ironed mask is quite nice. Wearing these masks with a face shield and coupled with apppropriate social distancing and hygiene I might be able to dodge this thing.

Nikole Hannah-Jones on the steps we need to take as a country to repare the damage we created building this nation: If true justice and equality are ever to be achieved in the United States, the country must finally take seriously what it owes black Americans. It’s not enough to fix policing, end job discrimination, or integrate schools. To restore balance in this country we must give black Americans the same opportunity as white Americans to succeed, build wealth, and care for their children and grandchildren. Wealth begets wealth, and white Americans have had centuries of government assistance to accumulate wealth, while the government has for the vast history of this country worked against black Americans doing the same.

In particular, I’ve been seeking a friction-free way to write. I think I’ve found it. I’ve long wanted to be able to blog as easily as one would tweet. Most content management systems put up a number of roadblocks. If it’s a struggle to post, however little, I’m less likely to do it. I know I’m an edge case here. As a broadcaster there’s zero friction to speaking my mind. I sit in front of a mic, form a thought, make some mouth noises, done. Writing is a much more painstaking process, and even though I’ve done a lot of it, it’s always felt like labor. I listen to writers do podcasts (I’m listening to Jon Gruber’s Talk Show from WWDC right now, for example) and I can feel how much harder it is for them to talk than write. Sometimes I can even hear them re-writing their words before they speak. I probably should do that more often, but I generally speak quickly and with little to no editing. To each his own but that’s my preferred way to create content. And how I’ve made my living for more than 40 years. But I do want to write. There are lots of reasons to put pen to paper. Writing forces a more thoughtful pace, requires more rigorous reasoning, and is the best way to develop complex ideas. It’s also more permanent, and, potentially, begs a more thoughtful response from readers. And, once I’m done, writing is more deeply satisfying. That makes sense. The more effort one puts into doing something, the more satisfying the sense of accomplishment will be when done. “I don’t like to write, but like having written.” – Frank Norris Writing is so much work for me that I don’t want to add any friction via the mechanics of posting what I’ve written. Ideally I’d fire up an editor, write something, save it, and it would magically appear as a post. I think that’s one reason Twitter is so successful. But… it’s also why Twitter is so full of ephemeral crap – it’s too easy. Twitter combines the worst of both worlds: thoughtless posting with a permanent record. That combo has bitten most of us over time. So I guess I don’t want to make it that easy. There should be enough friction to encourage thoughtful writing. That’s where the text editor comes in. Once I’m looking at all that blank real-estate on my screen I feel the need to fill it. There’s no jotting and posting here. I’m in writing mode. For a while I used Manton Reece’s micro.blog, “the fastest way to blog”. But it’s too fast. Like Twitter it encourages short off-the-cuff posts - and I wanted to encourage my monkey mind to work on longer pieces (like this). Also, after long experience, I’ve learned it’s best to host my own content. I want my stuff to live on my server, and to live in a form that’s easy to backup and move around (like, say, plaintext + markdown). So, my shopping list for a blog includes: Mostly friction-less posting Write anywhere: iPad, Mac, Linux Pick up writing anywhere else Self-hosted Clean, portable content Clean, attractive presentation I believe I’ve found all of the above here. My workflow at leo.fm varies, but over time it has evolved to the following. Hugo is running on my server with -w to watch for changes in the content folder1 I mount my web site locally using sshfs on all my machines, so I can create and edit posts on my local machines. When that file is saved or updated, hugo rebuilds the site instantly, and the post is up. You can’t get simpler than Ctrl-S to post.2 This is an wonderfully flexible workflow. That’s another requirement of friction-free posting, it has to work wherever I am. There are a number of ways I can create and edit posts. I’ve used emacs on the server for many posts. I like Panic’s Code Editor for the iPad, too. Its support for ssh, sftp, and editing makes the iPad a perfect way to work on the site. I actually started this post on my iPad using Code Editor3 but I’m finishing it on my Mac using the absolutely wonderful Typora (Mac/Windows/Linux).

Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts \" Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts Truth is I didn’t read it, I listened. And the Audible edition is beautifully brought to life by Humphrey Bower. Although in the midst of listening, I ended up buying both the paperback and Kindle edition to make it easier to take notes. Shantaram is the very nearly true story of an Australian, Lindsay, who flees to Bombay under a phony New Zealand passport after climbing over the wall of an Aussie prison. I say “very nearly true” because, even though he insists Shantaram is a work of fiction, Roberts’s real-life story closely mirrors his protagonist’s. Roberts also escaped Australian prison where he was serving time for armed robbery and fled to Bombay in the 80s before becoming a novelist. He insists that he invented the vivid characters that populate this epic, but even if they never existed they become flesh as the story winds on. And none more captivating than Prabaker, the first Indian Lin meets, and our guide to the steamy, fragrant, crowded streets of Bombay. There was something in the disk of his smile – a kind of mischievous exuberance, more honest and more excited than mere happiness – that pierced me to the heart. It was the work of a second, that eye contact between us. It was just long enough for me to trust him – the little man with the big smile. I didn’t know it then, but it was one of the best decisions of my life. Lin ends up falling in love, living in a slum, acting as a medic to its denizens, becomes a gangster, is shockingly beaten in an Indian jail. runs guns, money, and fake passports, and even joins the Mujahideen guerrillas in Afghanistan. But the most memorable part of the book for me is the idyllic months he spends in a remote Indian village with Prabaker’s family, where he earns the Marathi name, “Shantaram,” man of peace. It’s the calm before the storm in which Linbaba proves he’s anything but a peaceful man. The second half of Shantaram becomes more of a pot-boiler, but Roberts redeems the overheated prose with surprising insight into the human condition. I was moved many times to jot down an observation or epigram from the story. Roberts has a way of cutting to the heart of any moment. It’s an inspiring as well as an engaging first novel. Apple has optioned Shantaram and is planning to make it into a mini-series. I’m sure it will be good, but, as usual, I recommend reading the book first.

When I was a freshman in college I loved spouting grand theories. My smarter roommates would mock me, and eventually told me to stop spewing crap. I had fallen in love with stories: The stories we humans use to make sense out of an inexplicable world. But what I lacked at the time was the judgment to know which stories to believe, and which were utter bunk. I lacked a method to validate my stories. For as long as we’ve been talking, humans have told stories to make sense of the world, from creation myths, to Homer, to the big bang theory. We organize the constant stream of sensory inputs filtering into our brains by turning them into stories.1 Conspiracy theories are a particularly potent kind of story that soothe our anxieties by making sense of a chaotic world. They also stroke our egos because when we join into the conspiracy our intelligence and perception is affirmed. “I, of all people, see behind the curtain to understand the true inner mysteries of life.” We’re all susceptible to this, but these false narratives can be deadly. They often incorrectly demonize an out group, the Jews, the Illuminati, the liberals, the conservatives. Sometimes they convince us to burn 5G towers because they cause Covid-19, or not vaccinate our children because we think vaccines cause autism. That’s bad for us and bad for society. Jews were blamed for the Black Death and widely massacred in Europe in the 14th century, ostensibly because their religious practices caused them to succumb to the plague less often. This conspiracy theory helped ease gentiles’ fears by giving them a proximate cause for the inexplicable deaths and something they could do to fix it. It didn’t work, because, like most conspiracy theories, it was a fantasy. The plague was caused by fleas, not Jews. There’s a cure for conspiracy theories, and it emerged a couple of centuries later: the scientific method. The scientific method turns empty conjecture into provable fact. In a nutshell, a question about how something works leads to a hypothesis which experimentation can prove right or wrong. Why is the sky blue? leads to a prediction, filtering light through a prism separates it into its component colors, which can be tested, then proven, thus answering the question and adding to our understanding of the world around us. Conspiracy theories stop at hypothesis. The “proof” is simply that it “seems right” – it fits our world view. Of course, the worst proof of a conjecture is that it seems right, cf. confirmation bias, or that everyone you know believes it, or that it makes you feel part of the “in” group and smarter than the others. Those aren’t tests, they’re just ego strokes: attractive, tempting, but ultimately damaging. Science is a lot harder. It requires testing, and even then, nothing is written in stone. Scientific progress comes from the repeated application of the above steps backed by rigourous observation, peer review, and honesty. It’s a lot easier to just believe something, but it doesn’t add to our understanding of the world or our survival on this planet. Often belief without proof does just the opposite. Scientific method is useful, but it doesn’t produce “truth,” just a provable theory. The quest for knowledge doesn’t end with a good theory; it requires continued exploration and testing. There’s always a better theory. But it does help us progress toward the truth. And the proof of that is the success we’ve achieved in science and technology in the years since the invention of the method. Without Einstein’s Theory of Relativity there would be no GPS. If Newton didn’t exist, neither would SpaceX. The scientific method is so powerful and its success so breathtaking that it’s one of the marvels of our age.

If you’re going out, wear a mask and don’t take it off until you’re back inside. From a peer-reviewed1 article in The Proceedings of the NAS - Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19: Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic. This protective measure significantly reduces the number of infections. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. It turns out SARS-CoV-2 virus is particularly virulent when aerosolized. While transmission via direct or indirect contact occurs in a short range, airborne transmission via aerosols can occur over an extended distance and time. Inhaled virus-bearing aerosols deposit directly along the human respiratory tract. Transmission by aerosol is the last pathway for the virus that we haven’t stopped with hand-washing and social distancing, and it might be the most virulent form. Please wear your mask whenever you’re outside. Don’t take it off just because there’s no one around. The aerosolized virus can float in the air for hours and infect anyone who inhales it. Masks don’t show weakness, they show intelligence. Be smart, wear your mask! 😷 Wait a minute. Now there’s some issue with the paper and its peer-review. The problem seems to be that the paper overstates the importance of masks relative to other mitigations. Furthermore, there’s still debate over the path of infection. Some scientists say this paper overstates the evidence that aerosolized particles are the primary vector. ↩︎ ","date":"2020-06-13","objectID":"/2020/06/maskswork/:0:0","tags":["covid-19","masks"],"title":"Masks Work","uri":"/2020/06/maskswork/"},{"categories":["blog"],"content":"Leo Laporte and the TWiT Network offer a number of effective ways to reach technology consumers, influencers, and early adopters.

Until last week. The trip is only a couple of miles, and takes fewer than 10 minutes, but there’s one spot that always gives me the heebie jeebies. The Corona Road overpass is a narrow bridge with an even narrower bike path. Whenever I cross it I try to wait for a break in the traffic, and that’s been a lot easier during quarantine. But as the traffic’s been getting busier I’ve been getting more worried. And then, last week, the worst happened. One hour before I would have been crossing the bridge a bicyclist was hit and killed by a driver under the influence. I’ve crossed that spot hundreds of times, but no more. I don’t know Joze, but I feel for him and his family. From now on I’ll be crossing that bridge in my car and reserve my rides for somewhere safer.

But we all have to do it! According to Science Daily, reporting on a study from the University of Cambridge: The widespread use of face masks keeps the coronavirus reproduction number below 1.0, and prevents further waves when combined with lockdowns, new research suggests. A modeling study from the universities of Cambridge and Greenwich indicates that lockdowns alone will not stop the resurgence of COVID-19. Researchers say even homemade masks with limited effectiveness can dramatically reduce transmission rates if worn by enough people, regardless of whether they show symptoms. I love making my own masks. I even bought a sewing machine to do it (the inexpensive Bernina Bernett b35, now sold out everywhere!) With a little practice you can make a mask like this: It’s taken me a while to perfect this mask, but I love it because it’s relatively easy to make it’s convenient to wear and take off fit is snug and almost airtight it’s effective I started with this video then made some improvements: One of the nicest features of this mask is how you tie it. There’s one length of cord1 that goes around your neck and ties at the top of the head. It’s effectively a drawstring which helps fit the mask snugly as you tie it. The neck loop is handy because you can take off the mask but leave it hanging around your neck for quick donning.2 I’ve made some changes to the mask that makes it more comfortable and, I believe, more effective. First the materials. In the video the designer recommends two layers with a filter pocket. I tried this using high-threadcount cotton for the outer layer 3 and old t-shirts for the inner layer. The t-shirts are soft and comfortable but the pouch opening hits right at the mouth and kind of bothers me. And adding a filter layer (I tried vacuum cleaner bags and paper towels) really reduces breathe-ability. This is key; if it’s not easy to breathe in a mask you won’t wear it. After reading about research from the American Chemical Society about the effectiveness of various materials for mask making: One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of polyester-spandex chiffon – a sheer fabric often used in evening gowns – filtered out the most aerosol particles (80-99%, depending on particle size), with performance close to that of an N95 mask material. Substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or simply using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting, produced similar results. I decided to eliminate the superfluous filter pouch and replace the t-shirt cotton with silk charmeuse. It feels better, it’s much easier to sew, and the breathe-ability is excellent. Come winter, and yes I expect us to still be wearing masks this winter, I’ll replace the silk with flannel. To help seal the nose area I use peel and stick tin ties, the kind used to seal up coffee bags at the grocery store. I experimented with these by ripping them off all our coffee bags, but it turns out you can buy them by the hundred on Amazon, so no more open coffee bags at the Laporte house. Sealing the nose well is important for mask effectiveness and to keep my glasses from steaming up. If I’m not wearing glasses I’m wearing protective lab goggles. Keeping the mouth, nose, and eyes protected from aerosolized virus particles is the goal here. To soften the edges of the mask and block leaks around the edges, I have started folding all four edges in over a small strip of cotton quilt batting. The batting adds some structure and softness to the edges and, as I learned when I used it as a layer in one of my masks, is practically impermeable. The mask on the left is for my mom. At 87-years-old she finds it hard to tie the string behind her head so I replaced it with elastic. These masks are light, comfortable, and breathe-able. I don’t have any evidence that they’re more effective than any other mask, but I like to think so. Want to make your own masks?

For some reason I subscribe to them anyway. I use a filter to put any email with the word Unsubscribe in its body into a folder called Mailing Lists. This, at least, keeps my newsleters out of spam and out of my Inbox. From time to time I’ll cull through the stack and find something worth reading. Another issue complicating things is that, for security reasons, I don’t allow my email clients to render HTML or show images. Thus most newsletters look like an unintelligible bunch of cryptic nonsense.

I’m always glad when a newsletter puts a link to read on the web in the clear at the top of the message: View email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/ba623677f8e3/rk0l9ast4h?e=e15d8b4016) 1f0314a4-8aab-4e0f-926f-2f00a8e93e02.png Issue #489 - June 05, 2020 Double issue today because I missed yesterday's issue. Much nicer. This is Morning Cup of Coding (free) a nice little daily list of technical articles in all fields of software engineering from HumanReadable.io. As you might expect, Steven Levy does put that web referral up top in his new Plaintext (paywall) newsletter from Wired. Unfortunately the letter itself is delivered in an image heavy rich text format which means it’s unreadable unless you load images. Shouldn’t a newsletter called Plaintext be written in plain text? I’m sure this isn’t Steven’s choice; it’s probably something Conde Nast does. Worse, you have to pay for Wired to get it. Despite all that, it’s well worth it. Plaintext is a good example of why newsletters matter. It’s nothing like an article in Wired, or even an opinion piece. It’s like hearing from Levy directly and very much reflects his voice. I like that. Steven offers context, insight, and an intellectual’s perspective on tech news. This week, for example, he likened Facebook’s forbearance toward Donald Trump to Chamberlin’s appeasement at Munich. He says, “It’s time for the internet moguls to stop acting like Chamberlain —- and start channeling Churchill.” Of course I subscribe to newsletters from my co-hosts, Paul Thurrott (subscribers only) and Stacey Higginbotham (free), and TWiT’s own upcoming shows newsletter (free). But my post today is inspired by the news that one of the smartest people I know, Cory Doctorow, was leaving his long time ‘zine, Boing Boing. I love Cory’s insight, taste, and quirky eye, so I instantly subscribed to his daily newsletter, Plura-List (free). You can also read his links on the web at Pluralistic.net. I need my Cory fix.

And so are we. The way web sites look seems to change every few months, but even the way they work, and the very reason they exist has shifted since the first pages at twit.tv went up in 2005. I designed and implemented that original site by myself, choosing Drupal 4 as the content management system. It didn’t take long, as we added more shows and more hosts, for TWiT to outgrow that very simple original design. I asked Amber MacArthur, host of Inside The Net on TWiT, and her brother Jeff, to redesign the site. Their company, MGImedia Communications, crafted a new look and user interface for us and I hired the best Drupal programmers I knew, Lullabot, to implement it. TWiT.tv v2.0, engineered chiefly by Ted Serbinski, went live in 2007 and served us well for four years. But changes in our business and intense growth prompted another redesign by ImageX in 2011. By the end of 2014 I had decided it was time for another re-design, but this time I wanted to undertake something more ambitious. In talks about new media for more than 10 years I’ve been saying that our job was to provide content for our audience when they wanted, where they wanted, in any form they wanted, without limitations on how they could consume it. (I remember telling that to a convention of HBO employees in 2004 and almost being shown the door. But even HBO is coming around.) One of the reasons I’ve always made TWiT ad-supported is because it let us do that. It was in our interest to serve up our shows live or on-demand, in audio or video, and everywhere you wanted to watch. In the early days of TWiT that meant a web site to provide you with a directory of shows and RSS feeds. Most people, once they found out about TWiT, went to iTunes to subscribe. And that was how 90% of our audience listened for years.

Another 10% of our audience watches the live stream either on the web site or by plugging the URL into a video player like VLC. 30% download pre-recorded shows via the web site. All the rest, nearly half, use apps to watch or listen on their mobile phones, tablets, Rokus, TiVOs, Samsung TVs, many other platforms.1 I consider this a success. We’ve put TWiT in front of our audiences wherever they want it. But it means that our web site plays a very different role. And mobile apps are becoming increasingly important. As I began to appreciate this drastic change in how you watch and listen, I came to the realization that we needed to pay more attention to mobile while not ignoring the web. I, and many others, began to think of what we do as not broadcasting, or podcasting, but content as a service, or CaaS.2 That’s a pretty high-falutin’ term, but it does describe what we’re trying to do. RSS feeds were a step in this direction, making it possible for readers and listeners to subscribe to a feed and get content in any manner they wanted. Instead of forcing you to read the news in a newspaper or on a web page, RSS feeds let you decide how you’d read and in what form. But RSS doesn’t go far enough. We are taking it a step farther and creating a full-blown API that can deliver our content, all the meta-data associated with it, and additional information about our hosts, sponsors, and events on demand to any app that wants it. 3 Our new web site is just once consumer of this API. We’re developing new apps on iOS, Android, and Windows that will also use the API.4 And we’re inviting anyone who knows how to make a JSON call to create their own sites and apps. What we’re unveiling today is much more than a new web site, it’s a new way to deliver content that empowers my dream to give our audience the shows when they want, where they want, how they want without limits.

Instead they recommended a more modern and flexible tool called node.js. Unlike previous web sites, the site itself wouldn’t be a content management system, it would only be a representation of the content via the API. I liked the idea for several reasons. First, Drupal’s presentation is looking a little old and staid next to the spiffy, responsive sites other media companies are using. I liked the idea of being able to use a more modern tool like node.js. Second, by decoupling the backend from the presentation, it would be easier and faster to create new sites. Web design styles change faster than high fashion, so it’s nice to be able to update the site without re-doing all the hard work on the backend.6 ","date":"2020-06-01","objectID":"/2020/06/blastfromthepast/:0:4","tags":["twit","pwa","web design","history"],"title":"Five Years Later: The TWiT.tv Web Site","uri":"/2020/06/blastfromthepast/"},{"categories":["blog"],"content":"The Apps Third, having a complete API would make it easier to do apps.

We asked the Four Kitchens design team to create something very visual and clean. We feel that people come to the web site for two reasons: first because they googled one of us or were looking for tech information. Those people need to get a quick idea of what twit is and what we do. The front page is designed to do that with the big hero images, quick statements of purpose, and a gallery of recent shows in our three main categories: tech news, help and how-tos, and reviews.8 The second reason people come to the site is to find content. These people already know about TWiT, but they want to quickly find and download a show, watch the live stream, or seach for information they heard on a show. The top navigation reflects those primary purposes: Live, Shows, Apps, Search and More… (where we stick everything else). We’re using Apache Solr search and I think it’s a major upgrade to our old search. The site is fully mobile responsive and looks great on every size screen. You can see for yourself by resizing the page and refreshing. We think the site might even look best on mobile - and that’s good because that’s how most people surf these days!

Kevin Lamping did the dust programming. Peter Sieg was the node.js lead. Any missing or broken features are not their fault - they’re ours. We had a strict budget and weren’t abe to add many of the cool features we all wanted. But we have an ongoing support contract with Four Kitchens and hope to add the most requested missing features over time. We have a backlog of well over 100 features we didn’t have the time or money to implement in version 1.0 I also suspect we’ll be ready to do a second phase with Four Kitchens when everybody recovers from this one. In about a year.9 The stuff you don’t see is even more amazing. Four Kitchens’ Drupal dev David Diers took the lead here and worked many long hours (and weekends, too) to get us to launch. Matt Grill played the part of the cavalry, swooping in to make sure SSL worked right, and backing David on getting the API up and running. The two of them worked miracles, and if you enjoy the API, buy them a beer the next time you’re in Austin or San Diego (that’s where Matt is). I want to buy them a whole brewery.10 The entire process used the Agile methodology, and our project leaders, Paul Benjamin and Suzy Bates, kept the Jira log humming through 279 user stories and 730 points in nine sprints over the past six months. And if you know Agile you’ll know what that means. On the TWiT Team, credit to Patrick Delahanty who re-coded our workflow engine, Elroy, to interface with Drupal so that our editors and producers could move their entire data entry workflow to the Drupal backend. And he did it in about a month. Patrick is the official first API user. I managed the project with help from our CEO Lisa Laporte, Engineering Manager, Bruce Chezem, and analyst Jeff Needles. The Drupal 7.0 backend is running on Acquia servers11 using memcache and Varnish to speed things up. The web front end is running on Heroku. The API is documented at Apiary with key service from 3Scale. Node.js caching is provided by RedisLabs. Video and audio playback on the site is from JW Player. All TWiT shows and RSS feeds are stored and served by Cachefly. Many of the pictures you see on the site were shot by Jason Guy at JasonGuyPhotography.com.12 I hope you like the new TWiT.tv 4.0.

Written in the 1930s by a Lebanese-American poet named Kahlil Gibran, this admonition to parents matched our feelings, as teenagers, exactly. It’s something we parents often need to struggle to remember. Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the Archer’s hand be for gladness; For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable. – Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet Parents, teachers, family, and friends, for 18 years, give or take, we have been these graduates stable bow. Now they take flight into their new lives, leaving us behind, waving farewell. It’s sad for us in many ways, but it’s also exactly right. It’s time. Today marks the culmination of everything we have all worked so hard to achieve. We can truly say it is done, and it is good. Seniors, we send you out into the world, our hearts bursting with pride. We won’t burden you with our hopes and fears, but instead lift you with our love and together we will celebrate a joyous completion and a new beginning. We know you will fly far and high. We can’t wait to see where you land.

There’s a comfy armchair and ottoman I’ve had for years, a less comfy chair from the studio, a couple of side tables. Computers My desktop and computersMy Desk \" My desktop and computers Sitting on my desk in the office are: Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 gaming desk top from April 2021 Ryzen 7 5800 X (8-core, 32MB Cache 4.7GHz) Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 10Gb G DDR6X 128GB Dual Channel DDR4 XMP at 3400MHz 2TB M.2 SSD 2 TB SATA drive Dark Side of the Moon chassis with High-Performance CPU Liquid Cooling and 1000W Power Supply I use a 5TB Drobo Mini for backup. Apple Mac Studio Max M1 Max 32 GB RAM 1 TB SSD connected to a 4TB OWC Express 4M2 Thunderbolt 3 external drive Xbox Seriex X 1TB Each connected to a 55\" Alienware 120Hz 4K gaming monitor. I switch devices using the remote control that came with the monitor. Audio goes to a pair of Audioengine 2 wired speakers with an Audioengine S8 subwoofer beneath the desk. I use an Alienware 310K Mech. Gaming Keyboard and 510M RGB Gaming Mouse mostly to play Valheim. The Dell dual boots Manjaro Linux and Windows 11. When I’m not sitting at my desk, I primarily use one of my more portable devices: A 2021 Macbook Pro 14\" running Apple’s M1 Pro processor with 16 GB RAM and a 512 TB SSD (these days my go-to device) A 2021 Framework DIY Laptop with Intel i7-1185G7, 32GB RAM, 2TB M.2 drive and 1TB USB drive runing Manjaro A 2020 iPad Pro 12.9\" with the Magic Keyboard. A 2021 iPad Mini There’s also a 2016 17\" System76 Oryx Pro i7/32GB/2.5TB/GTX980 laptop. It weighs about 10 pounds but I don’t have the heart to give it away. It’s running, you guessed it, Manjaro Linux Gnome Edition. All my systems have synced Document, Source Code, and dotfile directories using the excellent and free open-source SyncThing. I keep system build instructions and scripts in Notion which I also use for fancy note-taking. For day-to-day notes, to-dos, and lists I use emacs org-mode. Because this site is running on a server (cf. The Beast) in the studio. I keep logged into it via a tmux session running over mosh on all the systems (even the iPad using the Blink terminal). An emacs daemon is always running on the Beast so it’s easy to jump into any post exactly where I left off from any system although right now I’m editing this using Emacs Tramp mode from home on my M1 Pro Macbook. This web site runs on hugo, so I simply save the markdown file, rebuild the site (it takes about 200 milliseconds to rebuild it from scratch with hugo) and jump back into emacs (^XS ^Z hugo fg - it’s practically muscle memory). If you see any stray XSs in any of the posts you’ll know I accidentally hit the shift key instead of the Control key. To avoid this I always map Caps Lock to the control key. The other tmux panes monitor the five Minecraft instances also running on the server (using Spigot), WeeChat IRC logged into the TWiT IRC channel, and our Jitsi videoconferencing server. Smartphones My daily carry is a two-year old T-Mobile iPhone 12 Pro Max in a red Apple silicon case. I also carry a Fi-based Google Pixel 6 Pro Android phone and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra on Verizon. I’m wearing a Series 6 Apple Watch or, occasionally, a Samsung Galaxy Watch4 and an Oura 3rd generation smart ring. Cameras I use a couple of different camera systems. I shoot stills with the Sony A7RIV mirrorless camera typically with Sony FE 24mm f1.4 GM or Zeiss Planar T* FE 50mm F1.4 FE lenses. My daily carry for street photography is a Leica Q2 with its fixed 28mm F1.7 lens. I carry the Leica in a beautiful case and strap from Angelo Pelle. A beautiful camera deserves a beautiful case. A/V For Zoom calls and audio recording on the iMac, I use a Heil PR-40 mic. It’s connected via USB using a SoundDevices MixPre-3.

I was organizing my posts by month folders, but it looks like LoveIt uses Hugo’s page bundles which means that each post ends up in its own directory (using the filename of the source file) in the root of the public folder. Does that mean that every post I ever write will have to have a unique name? Maybe Hugo has a way to solve this, but just in case I’ve re-written my newpost.fish function to append the current UNIX time in seconds to the filename so it’s unique. So the source file for this post, for example, is bundles1590002452.md. I’m still going to put the source files in the month folder. So, for example: is transformed by Hugo into the static files in the public folder here’s the new fish function code: ... set -l thepost \"post/\"(date +%Y-%m)\"/\"$argv(date +%s)\".md\" Update: After further exploration I’ve realized that hugo can use permalinks of the year-month form (check out the url of this post) and that I can organize the content folders that way, too. I no longer have to use crazy unique filenames. I only need to make sure a post filename is unique in any given month. So here’s the new (and I hope final) fish code to create a new post: ... # build the file name using the current year and month as dirs, $argv is the argument to the function # this generates a string like \"posts/2020/05/mypost.md\" set -l thepost \"posts/\"(date +%Y)\"/\"(date +%m)\"/\"$argv\".md\" ...

Start by using a password manager. We all need to use passwords all the time. The problem with passwords is that good ones are hard to remember. So people often use weak (but memorable passwords) and reuse them on site after site. A better way is to use a program that generates long, really random (hence unmemorable) passwords and keeps track of them so you don’t have to. That’s a password manager. If you only use your Mac and an iPhone, Apple can do this for you with the keychain. Your browser can also keep track of your passwords, if somewhat insecurely. BitWarden is open-source, inexpensive, and very secure. It generates long, strong passwords and remembers them for you. Lastpass and 1Password are also excellent and work the same way. Two more important tips: If you use Gmail, follow Google’s security advice at https://google.com/security – make sure to add a recovery phone number and email. Turn-on two factor authentication wherever you can. What programming language should I learn? If you merely want to get a job as quickly as possible go to one of the many coding camps and study Javascript. If you want to learn the art of programming. I recommend starting right with the free textbook How To Design Programs. HtDP uses the free DrRacket language and IDE. Racket is a lisp, but as they use it in the book it’s a much simplified teaching language. It’s intended to get out of the way so you can learn coding concepts without having to struggle with language syntax. There’s a well-done free pair of online courses from the University of British Columbia that teaches HtDP at edX.org. I highly recommend them (I’ve done them myself.) Once you’ve learned how to think about programs you can study any other language and you’ll be a better programmer for it. Can I promote X with you?
